# Clock Web Designing (using CSS)
This repo includes the web design for two clock interfaces. The first is analog, and the second is digital.

To make the clock work dynamically, we use javascript.

There are two seperate files, for analog and digital.

Each file contains four files seperately:

*1.main.html file* - The main html file, which is responsible for the webpage interface

*2.style.css file* - The css file which is used to style the web page interface.

*3.interface.png* - The screenshot of the interface of final webpage.

*4. working video file* - The video of the webpage
